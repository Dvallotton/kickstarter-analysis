# An analysis and challenges kickstart campaigns
This is an in depth analysis of Kickstarter campaigns that has been broken down into multiple categories. There are multiple tabs labeled for you to sort through. The challenge is this is alot of data to sort through even with the breakdowns. My biggest challenge is i could not get the last graph and information to match regardless of what i tried. would love feed back on that. 


## Theaters and Outcomes by launch date
We can accuratley conlcude that more succesful campaigns are started during the warmer months. May is the most successful month to start a campaign. See chart.

### Outcomes based on Goals
Goals tended to bemore successfull when the total was a more modest number. There really isn't enough data to completely determine the prospects of higher amounts.

#### Limitations of Data Sheet
Im not really sure what the limitations are other than there being large amouts to go through. I am positive i will get better at recognizing this.
